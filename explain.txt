 how to tell css where to apply in html
    there are 3 ways
                 
                inline css way(directly write insidethe tag)
                internal css way
                external css way----it  is same like internal css.we use same code everthing but diffence is we write in a different file.we creat a new file .and in head we link it to css
                 example
                 <head>
                 <title> web page</title>
                 <link rel="icon" href="./.....">
                 <link rel="stylesheet" href="./stylesheet">
                 </head>

types of element----inline  - block  - inline-block
day 4)1)percentage(instead of px its good to use percentage.px is fixed.if we minmize thescreen px is not minimized.)
